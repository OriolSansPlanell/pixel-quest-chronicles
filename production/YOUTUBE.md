# Publishing to YouTube automatically

Once this is set up, every new episode goes from story to YouTube with no one
touching it:

```
shift writes episode → relay commits it → release.yml renders the MP4 and makes the GitHub release
  → youtube.yml uploads it, sets the thumbnail, adds it to the playlist and schedules the premiere
  → daily youtube.yml run after the premiere → wiki episode page gets "Watch on YouTube"
```

Episodes premiere **in order, one per weekday at 15:00 New York time** (21:00 in Paris most of the year) (change it in
`production/youtube.json`). A backlog is spread over the following weekdays, so
the ten episodes already released fill two weeks.

Everything below is done once. Steps 1-6 take about 30 minutes; step 7 (Google's
audit) can take a few weeks, and uploads stay locked as private until it passes.

## 1. Create the channel

1. Sign in to YouTube with the Google account that will own the show, then go to
   **Settings → Add or manage your channel(s) → Create a channel**. Picking a
   *brand account* channel keeps it separate from your personal one and lets you
   add managers later.
2. Set the name, handle, picture and banner. Under **Settings → Channel → Feature
   eligibility**, verify by phone: custom thumbnails need it.
3. In YouTube Studio create a playlist, e.g. *Campaign 1: The Lantern Road*. Its id
   is the `list=` part of its URL; you'll need it in step 8.

## 2. Make a Google Cloud project with the YouTube API

1. Go to <https://console.cloud.google.com>, create a project (e.g. `pqc-youtube`).
2. **APIs & Services → Library → YouTube Data API v3 → Enable.**

## 3. Set up the OAuth consent screen and client

1. **Google Auth Platform → Branding** (older consoles: *OAuth consent screen*):
   app name *Nat 20 Pixels uploader*, your support email.
2. **Audience**: user type *External*, then **Publish app** so the status is
   **In production**. This matters: while it says *Testing*, Google expires the
   refresh token after 7 days and uploads stop.
3. **Data access**: add the scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube`.
4. **Clients → Create client** → type **Web application**, and under *Authorized
   redirect URIs* add `https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground`. Copy the
   **Client ID** and **Client secret**.

## 4. Get a refresh token (one time)

1. Open <https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground>.
2. Gear icon (top right) → tick **Use your own OAuth credentials** → paste the
   client id and secret.
3. In *Step 1*, type `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube` in the box and press
   **Authorize APIs**. Sign in with the channel's account and, if asked, pick the
   channel. Google warns the app is unverified: **Advanced → Go to … (unsafe)** is
   fine, it is your own app.
4. *Step 2* → **Exchange authorization code for tokens** → copy the **Refresh
   token**. Treat it like a password.

## 5. Store the three secrets in GitHub

Repository **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**:

| Name | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `YT_CLIENT_ID` | client id from step 3 |
| `YT_CLIENT_SECRET` | client secret from step 3 |
| `YT_REFRESH_TOKEN` | refresh token from step 4 |

## 6. Test it

**Actions → youtube → Run workflow**, command **check**: the log prints the
channel's name. Then run it with **plan**: it lists the episodes it would upload
and the premiere time of each, without uploading anything.

## 7. Pass Google's audit (needed for public videos)

Videos uploaded through the API by a project that hasn't been audited are locked
as private. Apply with the **YouTube API Services – Audit and Quota Extension
Form**: <https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_form>. What to say:

* It's an internal tool that uploads videos **to its owner's own channel only**;
  no other users sign in.
* It stores nothing except the uploaded video ids, in the public repository
  (`wiki/data/youtube.json`); the source is
  <https://github.com/OriolSansPlanell/pixel-quest-chronicles> (`scripts/youtube_upload.py`).
* API calls: `videos.insert`, `thumbnails.set`, `playlistItems.insert`,
  `channels.list`, a handful a day.

Until it's approved, publish by hand if you want to start: download the MP4 and
thumbnail from the episode's GitHub release, upload in YouTube Studio, paste the
release text as the description, and schedule it.

## 8. Switch it on

Edit `production/youtube.json`: `"enabled": true`, and `"playlist_id": "PL…"`
from step 1. Commit. The next run (after the next release, every day at 20:37
UTC, or **Run workflow → upload**) uploads everything released and not yet on
YouTube, up to five per run.

## Settings (`production/youtube.json`)

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled` | Uploads happen only when true. |
| `schedule` | `timezone`, `time`, `weekdays` (0 = Monday), `min_lead_hours`. `null` publishes at once with `privacy`. |
| `category_id` | 20 Gaming (default), 24 Entertainment, 1 Film & Animation. |
| `made_for_kids` | false: the show has combat and peril; YouTube asks every channel to declare this. |
| `contains_synthetic_media` | YouTube's "altered or synthetic content" label is for realistic footage that could mislead; a pixel-art fantasy cartoon doesn't need it. Set true if you prefer to label anyway. |
| `max_per_run` | Upload cap per run. |

Quota: each project gets 100 `videos.insert` calls a day in their own bucket, plus
10,000 units for everything else (`thumbnails.set` costs 50). A daily show uses a
tiny fraction.

## If something goes wrong

* `invalid_grant` in the log: the refresh token was revoked or expired (consent
  screen still in *Testing*?). Redo step 4 and update `YT_REFRESH_TOKEN`.
* Thumbnail not set: the channel isn't phone-verified (step 1.2). The video is fine.
* A video went up wrong: delete it in Studio, remove its line from
  `wiki/data/youtube.json`, and run the workflow again. It will take the next free
  slot. To keep the order, also remove the lines of every later episode and delete
  those videos.
