"""Generator for assets/maps/wending_mill.json and wending_mill_burning.json (C1E8, C1E9).

Wending Mill, a hamlet on the road south of Brindle Cross: a watermill whose
wheel turns in a millpond, a fenced mill yard where the road from the north
comes in, three cottages, haystacks and carts, a big barn on the east side
with open ground in front of it, and fields to the south-west.

The same layout is written twice: ``wending_mill`` (E8, the attack) and
``wending_mill_burning`` (E9: the barn is on fire and smoke hangs over the
yard). Water is terrain, so the pond is covered with invisible water_block
props to keep feet off it.
