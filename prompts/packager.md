# Step: YouTube packaging

Write the YouTube metadata for one episode of **Pixel Quest Chronicles**, a daily pixel-art D&D 5e story where every roll is real and shown on screen.

Call `submit_packaging` exactly once.

## Rules

* `title`: at most 70 characters, in the form `<Episode title> | Pixel Quest Chronicles C<campaign>E<episode>`. Curiosity, not clickbait; never spoil the episode's twist or who wins a fight.
* `description`: up to ~900 characters of your own text. First two lines: the hook (what's at stake today). Then one short paragraph on the episode without spoilers past its midpoint. Then one line inviting viewers to the wiki. Chapters, credits and the dice-seed line are appended automatically; don't write them.
* `tags`: 10-15 tags: the show, D&D 5e, pixel art, the characters' names and today's places.
* `thumbnail_text`: at most 24 characters, 2-4 punchy words, no episode number.
* `thumbnail_moment`: where the thumbnail frame is taken: a scene id (`s3`) or an encounter action (`e1:4` = action 4 of the fight). Pick the most striking image that does not spoil the ending.
